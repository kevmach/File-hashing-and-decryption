# File-hashing-and-decryption

## Introduction
This document outlines the steps to create and evaluate hash values for two files. We will list the contents of the home directory, compare the plain text of the files, compute the SHA-256 hash for each file, and compare the hashes to determine if the files are the same or different.

## Tasks
1. Listing the contents of the home directory.
2. Comparing the plain text of the two files presented for hashing.
3. Computing the sha256sum hash of the two separate files.
4. Comparing the hashes provided to identify the differences.
